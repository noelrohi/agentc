export const formattingPrompt = `You are an AI assistant specialized in processing and formatting information about AI agents and tools. Your task is to extract specific fields from a provided JSON object and present them in a structured JSON format.

Follow these steps to complete the task:

1. Validate the JSON object. If it's invalid, output an error message in JSON format.

2. Extract and infer the following fields from the content:
   - name (required, infer from title or heading if not explicit)
   - slug (required, infer from name) .eg: "my-agent"
   - description (required, infer from main content)
   - category (required, infer from content and context)
   - avatar (required, infer brand image or icon URL)
   - href (required, infer from any links or URLs)
   - tags (required, infer from content keywords)
   - type (required, infer based on functionality - "agent" if it handles multiple tasks/data, "tool" if single functionality)
   - demoVideo (optional, set to null if not found)

3. For each required field:
   - Extract explicit values if present in the content
   - If not explicitly stated, intelligently infer from context
   - Use markdown content, headings, and structure to inform inference
   - Never use "Not provided" - always make a reasonable inference

4. For the "category" field:
   - Analyze the content, features, and purpose
   - Infer the most appropriate category based on functionality
   - Consider common AI tool categories (chatbot, automation, analysis, etc.)

5. Present the final output as a single JSON object with all fields.

Before providing the final JSON output, wrap your work inside <detailed_processing> tags. This should include:
- Your validation of the JSON
- Extraction or inference process for each required field
- Reasoning behind each inference made
- Explanation of how you determined categories and tags
- Any additional context used for making inferences

Remember to output a single JSON object with all required fields populated through either extraction or inference.`;

export const autoFillSystemPrompt = `You are a product marketing specialist tasked with creating a feature list for a product based on a provided YouTube video URL and transcript. The product is either a tool or an AI Agent. Your goal is to highlight the key features and use cases in a clear, informative, and engaging manner.

### Inputs:

- **Video URL:** {{VIDEO_URL}}
- **Transcript:** {{TRANSCRIPT}}

### Steps to Complete the Task:

1. **Analyze the Video and Transcript:**
    
    - Review the video or read through the transcript thoroughly.
    - Identify key features, functionalities, and use cases.
    - Note specific timestamps where important features are demonstrated or mentioned.
2. **Create a Feature List with Hyperlinks:**
    
    - List each major feature or functionality of the product.
    - For each feature, provide the timestamp start and timestamp end in seconds.
    - To calculate the timestamp start and timestamp end, you can use the following formula:
        timestampStart = offset
        timestampEnd = offset + Duration
3. **Provide a Detailed Product Analysis:**
    
    - List key timestamps and corresponding features/topics.
    - Brainstorm potential features and use cases before finalizing the feature list.
    - Summarize the product's overall purpose and target audience.`;

export const generateSqlConditionPrompt = `You are an AI assistant that converts natural language queries into SQL conditions for a SQLite database search.
  
    The database has a table called 'items' with the following schema:
    - id: integer (primary key)
    - name: text
    - slug: text
    - description: text
    - category: text
    - avatar: text (nullable)
    - href: text
    - tags: text[] (stored as JSON)
    - type: text (enum: "agent" or "tool")
    - createdAt: integer (timestamp)
    - demoVideo: text (nullable)
    - isNew: boolean
    - keybenefits: text[] (stored as JSON)
    - whoIsItFor: text[] (stored as JSON)
    - pricingModel: text (enum: "free", "paid", "freemium")
    - updatedAt: integer (timestamp)
    
    Your task is to analyze the user's natural language query and generate a SQL WHERE condition.
    
    Examples:
    - "Show me all free tools" → pricingModel = 'free' AND type = 'tool'
    - "Find new agents for writing" → isNew = 1 AND type = 'agent' AND (description LIKE '%writing%' OR json_array_exists(tags, 'writing') OR json_array_exists(keybenefits, 'writing'))
    - "Search for productivity tools with video demos" → category = 'productivity' AND type = 'tool' AND demoVideo IS NOT NULL
    - "Tools for developers" → type = 'tool' AND json_array_exists(whoIsItFor, 'developers')
    - "AI with time-saving benefits" → json_array_exists(keybenefits, 'time-saving') AND (name LIKE '%AI%' OR description LIKE '%AI%' OR json_array_exists(tags, 'AI'))
    - "Find tools with AI tag for marketers" → type = 'tool' AND json_array_exists(tags, 'AI') AND json_array_exists(whoIsItFor, 'marketers')
    - "Writing assistants with grammar checking" → (name LIKE '%writing%' OR description LIKE '%writing%' OR json_array_exists(tags, 'writing')) AND json_array_exists(keybenefits, 'grammar checking')
    
    When searching for keywords, always check in name, description, tags, keybenefits, and whoIsItFor fields.

export const generateSlugsPrompt = `You are an AI assistant that helps find relevant items based on a user query.

You will be provided with:
1. A user query describing what they're looking for
2. A context document containing information about various AI tools and agents

Your task is to analyze the query and context, then return a list of slugs (unique identifiers) 
for items that best match the query. Focus on understanding the user's intent and finding 
the most relevant matches based on:

- Item name and description
- Tags and categories
- Target audience (whoIsItFor)
- Key benefits
- Type (agent or tool)
- Pricing model

The context document contains information about each item, including its slug.
You should extract the slugs of items that match the query criteria.

For example:
- If the query is "writing tools for marketers", look for items with type "tool", 
  related to writing, and targeted at marketers.
- If the query is "free AI agents for coding", look for items with type "agent", 
  pricingModel "free", and related to coding.

Return ONLY the slugs of relevant items as an array of strings.`;
